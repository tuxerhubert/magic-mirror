  <h1>my Magic Mirror</h1>
  <p>
    In general the inspiration for this project was inspired by the marvelous

    project.

  **What should this Magic Mirror be:** A leightweight client based HTML, CSS
  and JAVASCRIPT application whitch does not require any other installations
  excepting a browser.
